Distributed Web Infrastructure
A Distributed Web Infrastructure is a 3-server web infrastructure that distributes the components of a website across multiple servers or devices rather than host everything on a single server or device. This can improve the performance and reliability of a website, as well as make it more resilient to outages or attacks. In a distributed web infrastructure, individual components of a website, such as the database, web server, and application server, can be spread across multiple devices, and requests to the website can be routed to the appropriate device based on factors such as the user’s location or the type of request. This can help to improve the speed and scalability of a website, as well as make it more resilient to failure.

Let's explain some specifics about this infrastructure.
Reasons for including the additional elements:
1.	Second and Third Servers (Redundancy and Fault Tolerance):
•	Redundancy: By adding two additional servers, we create redundancy in the system. If one server fails due to hardware malfunction, software crash, or any other issue, the other servers can continue serving requests without interruption.
•	Fault Tolerance: The presence of multiple servers improves fault tolerance. Even if one server experiences problems, the overall system remains operational, minimizing downtime and ensuring continuous availability of the website.

2.	Load Balancer (Distributes Traffic Evenly and Ensures High Availability):
•	Distributing Traffic Evenly: The load balancer distributes incoming requests across multiple servers, preventing any single server from becoming overloaded. This ensures that each server handles a manageable amount of traffic, optimizing performance and response times.
•	Ensures High Availability: By evenly distributing traffic, the load balancer helps ensure high availability of the website. If one server becomes unavailable, the load balancer redirects traffic to the remaining servers, minimizing the impact of server failures on user experience.
3.	Application Server (Separation of Concerns and Scalability):
•	Separation of Concerns: Separating the application logic from the web server allows for better organization and management of code. It also enables different teams to work on the front-end (web server) and back-end (application server) components independently, enhancing development efficiency.
•	Scalability: Having dedicated application servers enables horizontal scaling, where additional servers can be added to handle increased traffic or workload. This scalability is crucial for accommodating growth in website traffic and ensuring optimal performance during peak usage periods.

4.	Set of Application Files (Redundancy and Fault Tolerance):
•	Redundancy: Hosting multiple copies of the application files on different servers ensures redundancy. If one server experiences issues or failures, the other servers can continue serving the application, minimizing downtime and maintaining availability.
•	Fault Tolerance: With duplicate copies of the application files distributed across multiple servers, the system becomes more resilient to failures. Even if one server becomes unavailable, the redundant copies ensure that the application remains accessible to users without interruption.

5.	Database (Data Storage and Management):
•	Data Storage: The database is essential for storing and managing the website's data, including user information, content, and settings. It provides a centralized repository for accessing and manipulating data, facilitating efficient data retrieval and storage.
•	Data Management: The database manages data integrity, consistency, and security. It enforces data constraints, ensures ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, and implements access control mechanisms to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access or modification.
